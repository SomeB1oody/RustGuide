# 1.1.1. Installing Rust from the Official Website

Go to the [Rust official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/), where you can set the language in the top-right corner.

Click "Get Started" and you will see the following interface:

Choose the appropriate version based on your operating system: 32-BIT for 32-bit systems and 64-BIT for 64-bit systems. Most computers today are 64-bit. If you are unsure, as long as your computer isn’t very old, downloading the 64-bit version should work fine.

To download Rust for **MacOS**, **Linux**, or the **Windows Linux Subsystem**, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Open the downloaded installer, and you will see the following interface:

There are three options:

- **Option 1 (Default):** Standard installation
- **Option 2:** Custom installation, allowing you to customize the installation path, components, toolchain version, etc.
- **Option 3:** Cancel installation

For most users, Option 1 is sufficient (either type 1 and press Enter, or just press Enter).

If you see the following screen, Rust has been successfully installed:

The installer will prompt you to restart your shell. Press Enter to exit the program. At this point, Rust installation is complete.

# 1.1.2. Command Line Operations for Rust
Rust commands can be executed in the terminal in Windows (Win11 includes it by default; if not, search for Windows Terminal in the Microsoft Store to download).
- **Update Rust:** rustup update
  Rust is a rapidly evolving language, so it’s recommended to perform this operation periodically to get the latest version.
- **Uninstall Rust:** rustup self uninstall
- **Verify Installation:** rustc --version or rustc -V

The result format: rustc x.y.z (xxxxxxxxx yyyy-mm-dd):
- x.y.z: Version number
- xxxxxxxxx: Current version’s hash value
- yyyy-mm-dd: Submission date of the current version
